        graphics::CANVAS_SCALE_WINDOW: The canvas size used for drawing corresponds to the current window size in pixel units. Custom canvas size
        provide via the setCanvasSize is ignored. Upon window size change, the canvas is adapted to be equal to the window client area
        resolution. This mode is useful if the graphics drawn must correspond to the specific image resolution of the window and should not
        be dynamically scaled.

        graphics::CANVAS_SCALE_STRETCH: The canvas is stretched to fill the entire window. When the aspect ratio of tyhe canvas as specified by the
        user does not match the window aspect ratio, the drawn contents will appear distorted (stretched or compressed).

         \image html resize2.jpg

        graphics::CANVAS_SCALE_FIT: The canvas is scaled to maximally fit the window but its aspect ratio is not affected. This means that if there
        is an aspect ration mismatch between the canvas and the window, the canvas will leave equal gaps along the axis of mismatch
        (centered). The window background outside the canvas will be painted with the user-defined background color. The drawn contents
        of the canvas will be clipped at the borders of the canvas and will not cross over to the elastic guard space.

    This callback function is invoked a) when an input event is triggered in the event processing loop of the engine,
    such as mouse state change or keyboard key press, b) at regularly timed intervals, so that time-dependent states
    in the application (such as animations, collisions, simulations) may advance their values.

    Typically, in the update callback function the developer places code for polling the input devices and using the
    time increment (passed as an argument) to update the application mechanics. Keep also in mind that the time increment
    passed in the callback is also globally available thoughout the code through the getDeltaTime() function.

    \param update is the user-defined function passed. The callback function must accept a single parameter, the
    time passed in miliseconds from the last triggered update.

    Typical usage:

    /** Loads all PNG bitmaps located in a directory specified by the argument dir at once.

        Preloading image assets prior to actually requesting a draw call with a brush that
        uses them can significantly boost performance during the typical draw call when a
        bitmap is first used.

        When a named image is used for a brush, the first time the
        library encounters the image asset with the specific unique name, it attempts to
        load the image, scale the bitmap to the closest power of two (if
        not already in the right resolution) and create the necessary internal representation
        for the underlying graphics API. For large assets, this process can take some time,
        noticeable as momentary freeze and general slowdown, depending on the size and number of
        images needed to be loaded. This of course happens only the first time a bitmap is
        used in the application, but can nevertheless degrade the user experience.

        preloadBitmaps performs the above process in bulk, for all PNG bitmaps found in the
        provided directory. This can be done during the application initialization stage,
        before the actual main interaction loop begins. The function can be called multiple
        times for a different directory each time, to progressively load organized collections
        of bitmaps. preloadBitmaps returns a vector of the bitmaps successfully loaded, which
        can be used as a means to validate that all assets have been properly loaded. Another useful
        application of the function is to load multiple bitmaps without the need to know the
        specific names beforehand. For example, one can organize the frames of an animation sequence
        into a separate folder and load all the sequence at once, maintaining the animation bitmap
        names for reference and cycling over the animation sequence. Another different application
        example is the call of the function on a directory to discover and load all images contained
        there to be able to list and preview the images during runtime (e.g. in an image viewer
        application).

        The preloadBitmaps function can be called at any time after the graphics initialization, i.e.
        after the call to createWindow.

        Please note that since a bitmap is identified by its fully qualified path, bitmaps with the same
        filename residing in different directories are treated as two different assets. Also note that
        multiple attempts to preload the same bitmap will report the bitmap as successfully loaded in the
        return vector, but the actual bitmap loaded the first time will be used and will not be replaced
        by the loader in subsequent calls. This means that during runtime, even if one modifies the
        bitmap asset externally and explicitly calls preloadBitmaps (or any other bitmap loading via a
        new brush creation), the original bitmap loaded the first time will be used.

        \param dir is the directory of the bitmaps to preload. Only PNG images will be loaded (extension is
        case-insensitive) and all other files in the directory will be ignored. The function is not
        called recursively for contained sub-directories.

        \return a vector of the full path names to the individual bitmaps identified and successfully loaded. The
        path names will include the directory name given.
